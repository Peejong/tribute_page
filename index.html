      <h2>Autobiography</h2>
      <p><strong>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</strong> was a Filipino nationalist and 
        polymath during the tail end of the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines. He is tagged 
        as the national hero (pambansang bayani) of the Filipino people. An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal 
        became a writer and a key member of the Filipino Propaganda Movement, which advocated political reforms for 
        the colony under Spain.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine Revolution,
        inspired by his writings, broke out. Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately
        approved of his goal which eventually led to Philippine independence 
      </p>
      <p>
        He is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to be honored by an 
        officially empaneled National Heroes Commitee. However, no law, executive order or proclamation has been enacted or issued
        officially proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a national hero.
